# What do meat-eaters buy together? Association rules on meat stores purchases patterns.
#### Aleksandra Bi≈Ças

## Introduction
Association rules are a set of methods which may easily describe patterns of customers purchases. They are widely used by FMCG companies as a recommendation engine input on websites, showing products that people similar to a current web-surfer also boughts. However for that companies usually need customers identifiers which is not always possible when a firm does not have a loyalty programme. In that case association rules might be leveraged as inbound promotions in the shape of pop-ups (recommendations) in Point of Sales.
